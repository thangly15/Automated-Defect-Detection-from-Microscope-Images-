# Automated-Defect-Detection-from-Microscope-Images-
Thang Ly built an automated defect detection system for microscope images of fabricated test coupons. The goal is to replace manual inspection with a reliable and consistent algorithm capable of identifying, marking, and counting various defects such as scratches, voids, surface particles, and irregular edges within micro-scale structures.
